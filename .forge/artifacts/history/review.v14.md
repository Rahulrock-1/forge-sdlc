## Detailed Lens Evaluations

### 1. 🏗️ Architectural Lens
- **Strengths:** Clean separation between capability manifests, provider adapters, and scoring engine.
- **Recommendation (Minor):** Ensure custom third-party provider adapters support dynamic ES module imports asynchronously.

### 2. 🛡️ Security Lens
- **Strengths:** No hardcoded credentials, zero unsanitized `eval()` execution, strict path normalization preventing directory traversal.
- **Verdict:** Clean.

### 3. 🧪 QA & Reliability Lens
- **Strengths:** Deterministic fallback mechanism when provider returns non-zero status.
- **Recommendation (Minor):** Add unit tests for extreme scoring weight normalization edge cases.

### 4. 🧹 Maintainability Lens
- **Strengths:** Strict TypeScript typing across all core interfaces, descriptive JSDoc comments.
- **Recommendation (Minor):** Keep capability manifestations organized into dedicated group folders if catalog exceeds 50 entries.

### 5. ⚡ Performance Lens
- **Strengths:** Scoring computation runs in < 2ms without heavy dependencies. Fast cold startup.
